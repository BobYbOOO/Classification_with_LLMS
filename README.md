# Classification with LLMs

## Introduction
Welcome to the `Classification_with_LLMS` project, a set of scripts in python leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification across diverse datasets. 

## Dataset Confidentiality
Due to Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and the proprietary nature of the datasets used in this project, I am unable to share the actual data publicly. 

- **Embedded Clusters and Embeddings**: I include the embeddings and clusters obtained during my experiments. 

- **Generic Datasets**: I recommend using publicly available datasets that are similar in nature to my proprietary datasets.
